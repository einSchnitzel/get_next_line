# get_next_line
## 42 Main course project

### A function returning the next line (delimited by a newline) without losing track on the position of the input string, even when using different file descriptors. Without reading any character twice through a variable BUFFER_SIZE.
### Through a static character array the remaining characters after the new line are passed onto the next function call, unless there is no newline found within the input string.

### passed with all bonuses:

####- usage of one static variable only
####- usage of multiple file descriptors without losing track.

## My takeaways:

### main lesson:  How to avoid segfaults, properly free and allocate memory.

### learned also: VS Code Debugger, manual debugging and basic use of containers with Docker.
### improved:     Usage of structs.
